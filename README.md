## Installation
I recommend installing pandas, since you will most likely use it.

    $ pip install pandas
    
Then, just install Dash. Plotly comes with Dash

    $ pip install dash
    
If you'd like to control the version of Plotly installed, you can do for example:

    $ pip install plotly==5.7.0
